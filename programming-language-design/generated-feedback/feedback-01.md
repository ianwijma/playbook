Thank you for sharing the code snippets of your new programming language. Here's some feedback on the provided lines:

1. **Namespace and Import System:**
    - The concept of namespaces and importing is a common practice in programming languages to organize and manage code. This part seems well-defined and aligns with the practices in other languages.

2. **Constants:**
    - Constants are well-defined and the export functionality for constants is a useful feature.

3. **Variables:**
    - Variable declarations are straightforward and easy to understand.
    - There's a duplicate definition of `percentage` (Float and Double). Consider using unique names to avoid confusion.

4. **Arrays:**
    - Array declaration and usage are clear.

5. **Destructuring:**
    - Destructuring arrays and structures is a useful feature.

6. **Structures:**
    - Structures are well-defined and allow nested structures, which is a powerful feature.
    - Exporting structures is a good idea for reusability.

7. **Methods:**
    - Method declaration syntax is clear and concise.
    - The ability to declare one-line and multi-line methods is great.
    - Exporting methods enhances modularity.
    - Overloading methods (methods with the same name but different parameter signatures) is a good feature for polymorphism.

8. **Semicolons:**
    - The optional semicolon is a common feature in modern programming languages and can make code less cluttered.

9. **String Templating:**
    - String templating with variables and method calls is a convenient feature.
    - Consider using consistent curly braces for string interpolation, as mixing them with escape sequences (`\{brackets\}`) could be confusing.

10. **Feedback and Considerations:**
    - Generally, the language looks well-structured and the features are consistent.
    - Consider adding more about data types (e.g., Enumerations), control structures (e.g., conditionals, loops), and error handling mechanisms.
    - Language documentation and examples would help users understand and adopt the language more easily.
    - Think about the scoping rules for variables, as this is an important aspect of any programming language.
    - Consider how the language handles memory management and resource allocation.

Remember, the success of a programming language largely depends on its simplicity, consistency, and utility. Keep iterating and refining your language based on feedback and real-world usage. Good luck with your language design journey!
